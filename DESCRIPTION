Description: This package is developed to investigate the association between zero-inflated longitudinal proportions and time to an event,e.g., disease onset. It is in particular applicable to microbiome proportion data from prospective studies,  specifically designed to handle the zero-inflated and highly skewed longitudinal microbial proportion data to examine whether the temporal pattern of microbial presence and/or the non-zero microbial proportions are associated with differences in the time to an event.
